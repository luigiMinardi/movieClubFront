In this project I used react, redux and styled-components to do a movie club website based on Netflix. **The Xilften!**

All the website style was made with styled components by me. The objective at start was to be as similar as possible with Netflix, but I started to put my things in many places like custom animations, etc.

## ‚ú® Features

If you hover your mouse in the Xilften logo it will hover accordingly to the side that you hovered (left or right).

The input has an animation that puts the label to the top when focussed.

The carousel is infinite from both sides, has an animation on hover, and if you click on the description you go to the rent page.

You can register, login and logout. You can left the register and continue later. You can rent and see the rented movies.

You can change your data from your profile.
